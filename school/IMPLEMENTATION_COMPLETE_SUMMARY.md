const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: amount * 100,
  currency: 'usd',
  payment_method_types: ['card'],
});
```

**PayPal:**
```javascript
const paypal = require('paypal-rest-sdk');

paypal.configure({
  mode: 'live',
  client_id: process.env.PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID,
  client_secret: process.env.PAYPAL_SECRET
});
```

### Email Service Integration

Replace console logging with real email:

**SendGrid:**
```javascript
const sgMail = require('@sendgrid/mail');
sgMail.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY);

await sgMail.send({
  to: email,
  from: 'noreply@schoolms.com',
  subject: 'Welcome to SchoolMS!',
  html: emailTemplate
});
