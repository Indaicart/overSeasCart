## 🎯 Recommendation

**I suggest implementing a "Student Portal" with these core features:**

1. **My Academic Dashboard**
   - Grades, subjects, performance

2. **My Attendance Portal**
   - View attendance, apply leave

3. **My Fees Portal**
   - View fees, pay online

4. **My Assignments**
   - View, submit, track

5. **My Timetable**
   - Daily schedule

**Should I implement these student-specific pages?** 🚀
