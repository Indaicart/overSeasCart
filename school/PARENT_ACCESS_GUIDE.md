## 🔒 Access Control for Parents

### What Parents CAN Do:
✅ View **ONLY their own children's** data
✅ Apply for leave on behalf of child
✅ Pay fees online
✅ Download report cards and receipts
✅ Message teachers
✅ Request meetings
✅ Update emergency contact information
✅ View school events and calendar

### What Parents CANNOT Do:
❌ View other children's data
❌ Edit grades or attendance
❌ Access admin functions
❌ View teacher personal information
❌ Modify school settings
❌ Access financial reports
❌ Delete records
❌ Submit assignments (only students can)

---

## 📊 Parent-Student Relationship

### Database Structure:
```
parents table
├── id
├── user_id (links to users table)
├── contact information
└── ...

student_parents table (junction table)
├── student_id (links to students)
├── parent_id (links to parents)
├── relationship (father/mother/guardian)
├── is_primary (primary contact?)
└── can_pickup (authorized to pick up?)

students table
├── id
├── user_id
└── ...
```

### How it Works:
1. Parent logs in
2. System finds parent_id
3. Queries `student_parents` table
4. Gets list of linked student_id(s)
5. Shows data for those students only
