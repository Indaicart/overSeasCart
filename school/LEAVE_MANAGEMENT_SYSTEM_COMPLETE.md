# 🎉 LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

## ✅ **BACKEND: 100% COMPLETE!**

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### **1. Database Tables (3 New Tables)** ✅

#### **`leave_types` Table:**
- Leave type configuration (CL, SL, EL, etc.)
- Annual quota per leave type
- Paid/unpaid flag ⭐
- Approval requirements
- Half-day support
- Carry-forward rules
- Notice period requirements

#### **`leave_balances` Table:**
- Annual leave allocation per staff
- Used, pending, available balances
- Carry-forward from previous year
- Real-time balance tracking

#### **`leave_applications` Table:**
- Leave application submission
- Date range & total days
- Half-day/Full-day support
- Status workflow (pending/approved/rejected/cancelled)
- Approval comments
- **Salary impact flag** ⭐
- **Salary deduction days** ⭐

---

### **2. Leave Helper Functions** ✅

File: `server/utils/leaveHelper.js`

**Functions:**
- `calculateLeaveDays()` - Calculate days between dates
- `generateApplicationNumber()` - Unique application IDs
- `checkLeaveBalance()` - Validate sufficient balance
- `updateLeaveBalance()` - Update after actions (reserve/approve/reject/cancel)
- `checkOverlappingLeaves()` - Prevent date conflicts
- `initializeLeaveBalances()` - Setup balances for new year/staff
- **`calculateUnpaidLeaveDays()`** ⭐ - Calculate unpaid leaves for salary deduction
- `getLeaveStats()` - Leave statistics

---

### **3. Leave Management API Routes** ✅

File: `server/routes/leaves.js`

#### **Leave Types:**
- `GET /api/leaves/types` - Get all leave types
- `POST /api/leaves/types` - Create leave type (Admin)

#### **Leave Balances:**
- `GET /api/leaves/balance` - Get my balance (Teacher)
- `GET /api/leaves/balance/:teacherId` - Get staff balance (Admin)
- `POST /api/leaves/balance/initialize` - Initialize balances (Admin)

#### **Leave Applications:**
- `GET /api/leaves/applications` - Get my applications (Teacher)
- `GET /api/leaves/applications/all` - Get all applications (Admin)
- `GET /api/leaves/applications/:id` - Get specific application
- `POST /api/leaves/applications` - Submit leave application (Teacher)
- `PUT /api/leaves/applications/:id/approve` - Approve (Admin)
- `PUT /api/leaves/applications/:id/reject` - Reject (Admin)
- `PUT /api/leaves/applications/:id/cancel` - Cancel own application

#### **Reports & Stats:**
- `GET /api/leaves/stats` - Get my leave stats
- `GET /api/leaves/calendar` - Leave calendar for month (Admin)
- **`GET /api/leaves/unpaid-days/:teacherId`** ⭐ - Calculate unpaid days

---

### **4. Payroll Integration** ✅ ⭐⭐⭐

#### **Auto-Deduction Logic:**

**Updated Files:**
- `server/routes/payroll.js`

**Changes Made:**
1. Import `calculateUnpaidLeaveDays` helper
2. **Offline Payment Processing:**
   - Calculate unpaid leave days for the month
   - Deduct from net salary: `perDaySalary × unpaidLeaveDays`
   - Add to salary breakdown
3. **Online Payment Processing:**
   - Calculate unpaid leave days for the month
   - Deduct from net salary before Razorpay
   - Add to salary breakdown

**Formula:**
```javascript
// Calculate per-day salary
perDaySalary = netSalary / workingDays

// Get unpaid leave days from leave system
unpaidLeaveDays = calculateUnpaidLeaveDays(teacherId, month, year)

// Calculate deduction
unpaidLeaveDeduction = perDaySalary × unpaidLeaveDays

// Apply to net salary
netSalary = netSalary - unpaidLeaveDeduction + bonus - penalty
```

## 📊 How It Works

### **Teacher Flow:**

```
1. Teacher: Apply for Leave
   ↓
2. System: Check leave balance
   ↓
3. If available → Reserve balance (pending)
   ↓
4. Admin: Approve/Reject
   ↓
5. If Approved → Move from pending to used
   If Rejected → Release reserved balance
   ↓
6. If unpaid leave → Mark affects_salary = true
   ↓
7. During Salary Processing:
   System automatically calculates unpaid days
   Deducts from monthly salary
   Shows in salary slip
```

---

### **Unpaid Leave Deduction Example:**

```
Staff: John Doe
Base Net Salary: ₹45,000/month
Working Days: 26

Approved Leaves in January:
- 2 days Casual Leave (CL) - PAID
- 3 days Unpaid Leave - UNPAID ⚠️

Salary Calculation:
Per-day salary = 45,000 / 26 = ₹1,730.77
Unpaid leave deduction = 1,730.77 × 3 = ₹5,192.31

Final Net Salary = 45,000 - 5,192.31 = ₹39,807.69
```
