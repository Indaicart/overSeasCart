## üí° Implementation Notes

### Development vs Production
- **Password Reset Code:** Currently shown in response for development
- **Production:** Remove `resetCode` from response, send via email
- **Session Timeout:** Can be configured per role (admins get longer timeout)
- **Activity Logs:** Consider data retention policy for production

### Performance Considerations
- Activity logs table will grow large - implement archiving strategy
- Session timeout uses browser events - minimal performance impact
- Password reset tokens auto-cleanup - schedule daily cron job

### Browser Compatibility
- Session timeout tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- All features use modern React hooks
- Tailwind CSS for responsive design

2. Review code comments
3. Test in development environment
4. Check browser console for errors
