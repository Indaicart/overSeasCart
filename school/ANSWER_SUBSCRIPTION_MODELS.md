# Did You Add Subscription Models? ✅ YES!

## Short Answer: **YES! I added complete subscription models!** 🎉

## What Was Added

### 1. **Database Table** 💾
Created `subscription_plans` table to store plans:
- **File:** `server/migrations/025_create_subscription_plans_table.js`
- Stores: name, pricing, limits, features, etc.

### 2. **Seed Data** 🌱
Created 4 pre-configured subscription plans:
- **File:** `server/seeds/004_seed_subscription_plans.js`
- Plans: Basic, Standard, Premium, Enterprise

### 3. **API Integration** 🔌
Updated API to fetch plans from database:
- **File:** `server/routes/subscriptions.js`
- Endpoint: `GET /api/subscriptions/plans`
