# Subscription Plans Setup Guide

Yes! I've now added **real subscription plans** stored in the database. Previously, they were hardcoded in the API. Now you have:

‚úÖ **Database table** for subscription plans

‚úÖ **Updated API** to fetch from database
‚úÖ **Easy management** - update plans in database

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run the Migration

This creates the `subscription_plans` table:

```bash
cd server
npm run migrate
```

Expected output:
```
Batch 25 run: 1 migration
025_create_subscription_plans_table.js
```

### Step 2: Seed the Plans

This populates the table with the 4 plans:

```bash
npm run seed
```

Expected output:
```
Ran 4 seed files
004_seed_subscription_plans.js
‚úÖ Subscription plans seeded successfully!
```

### Step 3: Verify in Database

Check that plans were created:

```sql
SELECT name, monthly_price, annual_price, max_students, max_teachers 
FROM subscription_plans 
ORDER BY display_order;
```

Expected result:
```
name        | monthly_price | annual_price | max_students | max_teachers
------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------
Basic       | 99.00         | 950.00       | 200          | 20
Standard    | 299.00        | 2400.00      | 500          | 50
Premium     | 599.00        | 4800.00      | 1000         | 100
Enterprise  | 999.00        | 8000.00      | 999999       | 999999
```

### Step 4: Test the API

Fetch plans from the API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/subscriptions/plans
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-here",
      "name": "Basic",
      "description": "Perfect for small schools and educational centers",
      "monthly_price": 99,
      "annual_price": 950,
      "max_students": 200,
      "max_teachers": 20,
      "storage_gb": 10,
      "features": "[\"Student Management\", ...]"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## üé® How It Works

### 1. **School Registration Page Fetches Plans**

When a school visits `/school-registration`:
1. Page loads
2. Fetches plans from `GET /api/subscriptions/plans`
3. Displays all active plans in card format
4. School selects their preferred plan
5. Proceeds to payment

### 2. **Plan Selection**

Schools see:
- Plan name and description
- Monthly and annual pricing
- Capacity limits (students, teachers, storage)
- Complete feature list
- Visual comparison cards

### 3. **Payment Processing**

When school completes registration:
1. Selected plan is passed to registration API
2. Plan details fetched from database
3. Subscription created with plan pricing
4. Payment recorded
5. School activated

## üîß Managing Plans

### View All Plans

```sql
SELECT * FROM subscription_plans ORDER BY display_order;
```

### Update Plan Pricing

```sql
UPDATE subscription_plans 
SET monthly_price = 149.00, annual_price = 1200.00
WHERE name = 'Basic';
```

### Add New Features to a Plan

```sql
UPDATE subscription_plans 
SET features = '[
  "Student Management",
  "Teacher Management",
  "NEW FEATURE HERE",
  ...
]'
WHERE name = 'Standard';
```

### Change Capacity Limits

```sql
UPDATE subscription_plans 
SET max_students = 300, max_teachers = 30
WHERE name = 'Basic';
```

### Deactivate a Plan

```sql
UPDATE subscription_plans 
SET is_active = false
WHERE name = 'Enterprise';
```

### Create New Plan

```sql
INSERT INTO subscription_plans (
  name, description, monthly_price, annual_price,
  max_students, max_teachers, storage_gb, features,
  is_active, display_order
) VALUES (
  'Starter',
  'Perfect for very small schools',
  49.00,
  470.00,
  50,
  5,
  5,
  '["Basic Features", "Email Support"]',
  true,
  0
);
```

## üéØ Benefits of Database Plans

### Before (Hardcoded):
‚ùå Plans locked in code
‚ùå Changing prices requires code update
‚ùå Can't add/remove plans easily
‚ùå No ability to deactivate plans
‚ùå No plan history tracking

### Now (Database):
‚úÖ Plans stored in database
‚úÖ Update prices with SQL
‚úÖ Add/remove plans anytime
‚úÖ Activate/deactivate plans
‚úÖ Track plan changes
‚úÖ Easy to manage via admin panel (future)

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### 1. Registration Page
```javascript
// Fetches plans from database
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/subscriptions/plans');
const data = await response.json();
setPlans(data.data);
```

### 2. Registration API
```javascript
// Looks up plan by name
const plan = await db('subscription_plans')
  .where({ name: subscription.plan_name })
  .first();

// Uses plan pricing for subscription
const amount = subscription.billing_cycle === 'annual' 
  ? plan.annual_price 
  : plan.monthly_price;
```

---

## üß™ Testing

### Test Plan Fetching

1. **Start server:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
